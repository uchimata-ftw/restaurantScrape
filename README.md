# restaurantScrape
In-house tool to pull restaurant names and addresses and write them to a csv files

run in commandline and copy web address to clipboard

ex.
~$  python3 restaurantScrape.py


Tips:
    *Use vim to quickly reformat address.csv and phone.csv
    *Line numbers coincide with item number exactly so if you have a restaurant that doesn't have an address, put N/A on the corrisponding line number and the rest will be in order.
